# Using math in the presentation

- The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean, so the right side of the center is a mirror image of the left side.

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$
